FOR WINDOWS:
0. INSTALL PYTHON 3.6 AND MAKE SURE THAT DIDN'T MESS UP (python --version)
1. CREATE A DIRECTORY SOMEWHERE CONVIENIENT
2. cd INTO IT
3. pip install virtualenv (I did this in cmd prompt - Jatin)
4. RUN python -m virtualenv [whatever you want to call your virtual environment]. YOU WILL HAVE TO EITHER DO THIS FROM PYTHON COMMAND LINE OR SET YOUR SYSTEM PATH TO INCLUDE PYTHON (I did this in cmd prompt - Jatin)
5. (DOES NOT HAVE TO BE DONE WITH COMMAND LINE) COPY THE REQUIREMENTS.TXT FROM SENIOR-PROJECT/BACKEND/REQUIREMENTS.TXT INTO THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT DIRECTORY MADE IN STEP (3)
6. cd INTO THE V. ENV DIRECTORY FROM STEP (3)
7. RUN Scripts\activate (MAY NEED .\ ON THE FRONT)
8. YOU SHOULD SEE THE NAME OF YOUR V.ENV APPEAR LIKE (VENV NAME) ON YOUR CMD LINE.
9. RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
10. IF THIS WORKS, THE INSTALL PROBABLY WORKED. KEEP THE V.ENV ACTIVE AND CD TO Senior-Project/backend/ AND RUN python manage.py check
11. IF THIS WORKS YOU'RE GOOD. FROM NOW ON ACTIVATE YOUR VENV BY JUST SPECIFYING THE PATH TO ITS ACTIVATE SCRIPT (AS IN STEP 6, CAN BE DONE FROM ANYWHERE AS LONG AS YOU SPECIFY FULL PATH), THEN RUN python manage.py runserver FROM THE DIRECTORY IN STEP (9)

FOR QUITTING SERVER AND VIRTUALENV:
1. Quit the server with CTRL-BREAK
2. RUN deactivate or close cmd prompt to stop running your virtualenv
